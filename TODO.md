TODO
fix multiple pairs handling
Specify on the first launch or while adding a new pair file type that can be transferred, or if the user wants *.*
Make a quiet mode (CLI does not appear)
Error handling when the path in the config.ini exists, but an incorrect path is written (maybe deleting config.ini and creating a new works? To force a new setup)
